			<h2>Marketing & Frontend</h2>
			<p>
				With the internet being the go-to source for fitness information, 
				it can be daunting for someone looking to get fit to sift through 
				all the available content and find information relevant to their physique. 
				FitFind seeks to provide users with information on health and fitness, 
				tailored to meet their unique fitness level and knowledge, 
				helping people maintain their healthy lifestyles or start one.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Over the next year we have established several marketing goals that 
				we feel will help FitFind grow. In order to get the word out 
				we will initially target UW athletic clubs, 
				since they seem to be the group most likely to be interested 
				in a health and fitness application and spread the word out to friends. 
				Once we have grown a small user base we will try and engage with them 
				through Social Media. Our goal there will be to inform users of new or 
				improved features in order to entice them to keep using FitFind. 
				Additionally, we feel that having some sort of feedback mechanism 
				will be helpful not only for initial troubleshooting with bugs that 
				users have but also for tips that our users may have to improve FitFind.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Our users are those who want to find information about exercises, 
				maintaining physical health, and nutrition. 
				They can range from people who have not worked out in a long time and want to start 
				and are looking for nearby gyms. They can also be someone who works daily and 
				is looking for something to change up their routine with new exercises. 
				As well FitFind will be able to be a research source for elite athletes looking for 
				specialized information on scientific studies or new supplements.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The competition we face will mostly will be similar search services like IDEA.  
				IDEA is an integrative search engine for users to look for local fitness professionals, 
				health clubs and fitness classes supported by a lot of sports partners. 
				We will also face competition from sites like Health.com. 
				While not a search service, they are still significant competitors due to the fact 
				that they host the same content for which our service searches.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Potential collaborators we identified as being atheletic clubs, 
				local fitness centers, and sports clubs which can serve to direct users our way.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We feel that our team will be able to accomplish these goals considering our skills sets. 
				Our teams skill set varies widely, each member of the group brings something different. 
				As a group, we have a good mix of front-end and back-end experience, 
				with some having a creative eye for marketing and expansion, 
				while others are knowledgeable about user needs and the nature of the content being dealt with.

			<h2>Technical & Backend</h2>
			<p>
			We took advantage of several of the basic backend features of the Solr package.  As backend information is communicated as JSON code directly to our frontend Javascript file (via an Ajax request), we had a great degree of flexibility in implementing backend features.  
			
			We experimented and implemented spellcheck by parsing an automated spellcheck array created by Solr (which determines relevant query suggestions based on content words) and displaying the contents as clickable query links.  We also took advantage of Solr’s query highlighting feature (which simply looks for query matches within site content) by translating JSON information to our onsite HTML.  We tinkered with Solr’s basic boosting feature to prioritize title, keyword, and query content elements in search results.  With our user profile component, we were looking for a way to more thoroughly filer content based upon user parameters.  With the lack of Solr instruction in this particular area, we felt a bit overwhelmed and opted for a solution which involved appending information to the user’s original query that matched the users chosen parameters.  
			
			While we did manage to get cookies working at first, to store user profile information, the backend handling (php) of this resulted in bugs with our Solr backend implementation.

			<h2>Interim Results & Evaluations</h2>
			<p>
				1. any web analytics data of interest for your site -- esp. as this relates to your targeted users and competition (as described in the marketing plan).
				2. any UX evaluations you have done -- even informal evaluations with friends and family.
				3. any evaluations you have done of search results for recall and precision (e.g.. for targeted queries, as verified by 2 or more people -- friends, or even team members) how good are the results returned? What is P@N (for targeted N)? are you getting back results that you would expect to get back?
				4. and then how are your techniques of SEO working out?
